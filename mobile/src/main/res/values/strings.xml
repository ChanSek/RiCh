    <p>Being a part of this weird society, it is difficult to make the earlier generation understand that dowry is not a good practice.
       But unfortunately it is being practiced heavily in India in the name of tradition. Even we have tried to break this tradition and failed miserably.</p>
    <p>Well we are not from those who accept the defeat easily. So the solution we conclude is:
       <br/>I (Chandra Sekhar) will return the dowry after the marriage or donate it for some good cause. I hope, it will come to true soon.</p>
